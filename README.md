## Hi! I'm Matt.

I'm a qualified light vehicle mechanic, having completed my 4 year apprenticeship at a performance vehicle dealership in the Adelaide Hills. Motorsport is my passion, and I've experienced working as a motorsport mechanic     at a professional level. I'm fortunate enough to compete as a racing driver myself - racing has always been a part of my life, and as a result I'm very competitive in everything that I do.

Currently studying full stack development at the University of Adelaide - fluent in <b>HTML5, CSS3</b> and <b>Javascript</b> with skills in other technologies such as <b>Git, jQuery, MySQL</b> and <b>VS Code</b>.

I have extensive graphic design and film experience, and am proficient in <b>After Effects, Premiere Pro, Illustrator, InDesign</b> and <b>Photoshop</b>. 

From reading this, you have probably realised that I love making things, building things and understanding why and how they work. If you did, I'd love to work with you!
