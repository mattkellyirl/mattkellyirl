<p>Hi! I'm Matt.
  <br>
  I'm a qualified light vehicle mechanic, having completed my 4 year apprenticeship at a performance vehicle dealership in the Adelaide Hills. Motorsport is my passion, and I've experienced working as a motorsport mechanic     at a professional level. I'm fortunate enough to compete as a racing driver myself - racing has always been a part of my life, and as a result I'm very competitive in everything that I do.
  <br>
  Currently studying full stack development at the University of Adelaide - fluent in HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript with skills in other technologies such as Git, jQuery, MySQL and VS Code.
  <br>
  I have extensive graphic design and film experience, and am proficient in After Effects, Premiere Pro, Illustrator, InDesign and Photoshop. 
  <br>
  From reading this, you have probably realised that I love making things, building things and understanding why and how they work. If you did, I'd love to work with you!</p>
