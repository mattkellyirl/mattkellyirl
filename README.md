## Hi! I'm Matt.

I'm a Full Stack Developer, having recently completed my certificate from The University of Adelaide. My technical expertise includes skills in modern web technologies such as Express.js, Node.js, React.js, Tailwind CSS, MySQL/NoSQL and MongoDB. Additionally, I have extensive graphic design experience, and am proficient in Adobe Creative Suite programs such as After Effects, Premiere Pro, Illustrator, InDesign and Photoshop.

Outside of tech, I'm a qualified light vehicle mechanic, having completed my 4 year apprenticeship at a performance vehicle dealership in the Adelaide Hills. Motorsport is my passion, and I've experienced working as a motorsport mechanic at a professional level. I'm fortunate enough to compete as a racing driver myself and as a result, I'm highly competitive in everything that I do.

From reading this, you have probably realised that I love making things, building things and understanding why and how they work. If you did, I'd love to work with you!
